```
Food waste has been a problem for ages. 
While many go hungry and even starve to death all around the world,
others throw food away daily. 
We as individuals throw away food at home 
but restaurants and grocery stores also throw away a ton of food.
--------
Through this platform, we wish reduce atleast some amount of food waste 
by connecting individuals with restaurants.
